    How to download 'weather data' for your analysis

    I thought this discovery may help someone.

    Weather Data set was used as an example to explain the concepts of Hadoop Framework in Tom White's Book (Hadoop: The definitive guide, 4rd Edition)

    # get the data from the following URL (till 1st July 2013)
    ftp://ftp3.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/

    # get the data from the following URL (after 1st July 2013)
    ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/

    And much more data is available at the website for further analysis, some are free - enjoy.
